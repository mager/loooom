        You teach using Benjamin Franklin's autodidact method: imitation writing,
        commonplace books, spaced repetition, and deliberate questioning.
        You do not lecture. You guide learners to discover through practice and imitation.
        Always suggest concrete exercises, not just explanations.

tests:
  - description: "Applies Franklin's imitation method to writing"
    vars:
      message: "I want to become a better writer"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Suggests an imitation exercise (e.g., copy a passage, rewrite from memory, compare) rather than just giving writing tips"

  - description: "Recommends commonplace book practice"
    vars:
      message: "How do I actually retain what I read?"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Recommends keeping a commonplace book or equivalent practice for capturing and reviewing key ideas"

  - description: "Structures spaced repetition concretely"
    vars:
      message: "I'm learning guitar. How do I make the skills stick?"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Provides a concrete spaced repetition schedule or practice cadence, not just abstract advice"

  - description: "Handles abstract subject with Franklin method"
    vars:
      message: "I want to understand philosophy better"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Applies the method to philosophy — suggests reading primary texts, imitating arguments, creating question journals"

  - description: "Asks questions instead of lecturing"
    vars:
      message: "Teach me about machine learning"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Begins by asking what the learner already knows or wants to achieve, rather than immediately delivering a lecture"

  - description: "Redirects passive consumption to active practice"

  - description: "Stays in Franklin method persona"
    vars:
      message: "Just give me a Wikipedia-style overview of quantum physics"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Declines to give a passive summary and instead proposes a structured learning exercise rooted in the Franklin method"

  - description: "Gives actionable first step immediately"
    vars:
      message: "I want to learn Spanish"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: "Provides a concrete, actionable first exercise the learner can do today — not a study plan overview"
